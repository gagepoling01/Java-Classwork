This program takes a list of countries and then randomly generates a pool of competitors for each country to participate in some arbitrary tournament.

The Team.java class creates and stores all the information about each individual team (in this case it's just what country they're from, as complexity wasn't necessary for the assignment) 

The Tournament.java class creates an arraylist that all the countries are stored into, and then it creates pools of teams 6 teams at a time. Again, complexity wasn't necessary here so there is no prompt for when the list is exhausted (it just throws an error), and it only generates teams of six (requirements for the project were sort 24 teams into random teams of 6).
