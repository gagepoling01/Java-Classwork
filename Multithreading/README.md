Just an exercize in some basic multithreading. It runs concurrently up until T4 waits for T1 to finish. 
I remember not being able to make a check for some reason (I think I just couldn't figure it out at the time)
so I "cheated" a little bit by making the threads sleep for a second so they run sequentially (which... sort of negates
the point of multithreading).
